A python program that gets a string as input, partitions it in letters that duplicate them selves, and prints an array with the partitioned sting.

Run the following command in the downloaded folder:
<code>python3 partition.py </code>

E.G. for the workflow:

**Input**: <code>atestingly</code>

**Output**: <code>['a', 'test', 'i', 'n', 'g', 'l', 'y']</code>

After that, the user is asked if he wants to enter a new string. Answering ['yes', 'y', 'YES', 'Y'] reruns the program.
